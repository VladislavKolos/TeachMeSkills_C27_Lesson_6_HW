Homework for the sixth lesson 

1. **task1** we created a class "CreditCard" with the fields "bankAccountNumber" and "amountOnAccount". Created one constructor with two parameters. In the new class "Operations" created methods for adding and withdrawing amounts and outputting information to the console. Operations are performed, objects are created, methods are called in the new class "Main".

3. **task2** we created a class "Student" to describe the students in our group. Fields of the class "Student": firstName, lastName, passId, groupName. In the new class "Basis" created objects of the class "Student" for each of the students in our group. Placed all these objects in an array. In the new class "Output" created a method in which we went through the array with a for-each loop and output the information to the console.
